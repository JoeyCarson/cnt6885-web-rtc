This was my final project for graduate course CNT 6885 - Intro to Video Communication.
It implements a light WebRTC video chat room.  The server itself enumerates all peers and each peer will initiate
a call to each new peer as they show up, creating a google hangouts sort of experience without the concept of
separate rooms.  The server itself behaves as a single room.
